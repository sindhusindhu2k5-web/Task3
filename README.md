✨ Tic Tac Toe Game 🎮
🧠 About the Project

This is a Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 💻.
It’s a simple yet engaging web-based game where two players — X and O — take turns to mark spaces in a 3×3 grid.
The first player to align three marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins the match 🏆.

This project was created as part of my SkillCraft Task to strengthen my front-end web development skills.
